# CAN Whisperer

> One line per day is still infinitely more than zero.

This is a slow-burning dream project by a dev who loves cars, bytes, and backstories.

**CAN Whisperer** is a personal exploration into car diagnostics, ECU comms, and CAN bus wizardry.  
It's not perfect, it's not ready, and it's not even sure what it'll become—but it's moving.

## Goals

- Read and decode CAN messages from a car
- Build a tool to log and visualize live data
- Create open-source solutions for real-world car debugging
- Learn everything on the way, and share that knowledge

## Status

This repo is in its "turtle stage"
Expect occasional commits, strange code, and bursts of clarity.

## License

MIT — because I believe in sharing and learning.
