# CAN Whisperer â€“ Roadmap

This is my dev diary and idea board. Everything's allowed here.

## Step 1:
- [ ] Read about CAN message structure
- [ ] Choose my first interface (CANable vs OpenPort)
- [ ] Write a Python script that sniffs raw data from OBD2 port

## Random Thoughts
- Try building a live dashboard
- Can I simulate CAN traffic?
